    <td>In the first lesson we had to restart our github pages completely. So I immediately deleted all my pages and started making new blogs.I made progress my focusing on my own work and trying not to get distracted. Throughout the year we need to go through many challenges such as doing different github/ repl.it tasks.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Maybe take notes and focus on my own work. Throughout the lessons I went on buzzfeed quizzes and got a bit distracted and spent more time on the quizzes than the actual work. So a target for me next time would be to concentrate more on the work and not get distracted.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try not to get distracted as much as I did in a few lessons. I  will just get on with the work set as getting distracted doesn't allow me to work efficiently.</td>
